# Spotify Mood Predictor

A data science project that predicts the mood of songs based on Spotify audio features using machine learning.

## Project Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict the mood of songs based on Spotify audio features such as tempo, danceability, energy, valence, and more. The model categorizes songs into four moods:

- **Happy**: Songs with high valence (> 0.6)
- **Sad**: Songs with low valence (< 0.4)
- **Energetic**: Songs with high energy (> 0.7) and medium valence (0.4-0.6)
- **Neutral**: Songs that don't fit in the above categories

## Features

- Data preprocessing pipeline with null value handling and feature scaling
- Mood classification based on Spotify audio features
- Two machine learning models: K-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Tree Classifier
- Model evaluation with cross-validation and performance metrics
- Hyperparameter optimization for both models
- Interactive Streamlit web app for testing predictions
- Visualization of confusion matrices and feature importance

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spotify-mood-predictor.git
cd spotify-mood-predictor
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Pipeline

To run the full data pipeline (data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation):

```bash
python src/main.py
```

Command-line options:
- `--data_path`: Path to your own Spotify dataset file (CSV or Excel)
- `--model_type`: Type of model to train (`knn`, `decision_tree`, or `both`)
- `--optimize`: Flag to perform hyperparameter optimization
- `--no_save`: Flag to not save the trained models

If no data path is provided, the script will generate a sample dataset.

### Running the Web App

To launch the Streamlit web app:

```bash
cd app
streamlit run app.py
```

The app allows you to:
- Adjust audio features using sliders
- Predict the mood based on the selected features
- Visualize the features and their impact on the mood
- Switch between different trained models

## Data

This project can work with any Spotify dataset that contains the following audio features:
- `valence`: Musical positiveness (0.0 to 1.0)
- `energy`: Energy level (0.0 to 1.0)
- `danceability`: How suitable for dancing (0.0 to 1.0)
- `tempo`: Speed in beats per minute (BPM)
- `loudness`: Overall loudness in decibels (dB)
- `acousticness`: Acoustic level (0.0 to 1.0)
- `instrumentalness`: Instrumental level (0.0 to 1.0)
- `liveness`: Presence of audience (0.0 to 1.0)
- `speechiness`: Presence of spoken words (0.0 to 1.0)

The project includes a function to generate a sample dataset if you don't have one.
